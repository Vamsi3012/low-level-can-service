Generated Files
================

This directory holds generated implementation files for the Protocol Buffer
objects defined in openxc.proto. The definitions don't change very often, and so
it makes more sense to keep a compiled version in the repository for each
major build environment rather than requiring each developer to get the protobuf
dependencies.

I've also not found a good way to incorporate protobuf generation with our
Makefile build system in the openxc/vi-firmware project.
